This code assessment is intended to test your competency by providing a set of designs and functionality requirements similar to those that you would receive day to day on the job.  You will be given a window of time in which to complete as many of the requirements as possible.

## Overview

This code test is modeled You are tasked with converting [these designs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z9pgouu5b6jbsfe/Code%20Test.xd?dl=0) to a fully functional web application. 

Prior to the test, we will review the requirements with you via screen share.  Do your best to anticipate any questions and ask them during the review.  If you need to skip or deviate from the requirements for any reason, or if a question arises after the review session, please create a readme documenting your thoughts and push it to the repo.  This will give us insight into your written communication style, as well as your approach to problem solving.

Points are awarded based on the number of quality features completed within the allotted time.  Partial credit will be awarded for functionality with bugs.  Prioritize quality over quantity.  One polished feature without bugs is given more value than several half-baked features.  

Architecture and readability will also be considered.  This includes an assessment of your understanding and implementation of general best practices related to architecture, code readability, and sustainability.  Weâ€™re looking for quality but not perfection in the following:
    
- Proper use of Laravel architecture and concepts, such as routing, models, controllers, query building, etc.
- Adherence to database schema best practices.
- Code readability including code spacing, formatting, file and variable naming.

## Tech Requirements

The following technologies/packages are required to complete this code assessment:
Git
Package managers (Composer and NPM)
Laravel
Vue.js
Tailwind CSS

The use of any additional packages or libraries is at your discretion.  Using a 3rd party package to satisfy a requirement will not negatively impact your score, unless the package is clearly unsustainable for any reason (deprecation, lack of support, dependency problems, etc).

## Turning In Your Work

When you have completed this test, please open up a PR for us to review. If any of your work needs clarification, this would be the place to do it.
